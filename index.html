        <h2>About me</h2>
        <p>Hello,
            My name is Cetin and I am an electrical engineer.
            For long years I worked in industrial facilities and managed production and maintenance departments. Three years ago I joined IT.
            Between 2019 and 2021 I worked on a ride-sharing project and designed a charging station with Raspberry PI3 and created a socket server/client with Python. During that project, I learned Python, Linux, SQL, MongoDB, HTML, and CSS.
            In 2021 i started to work as a freelancer by the time I continued to study.
            By the time I studied, Linux, SQL, Git, Flask and FastAPI. Also learned the fundamentals of Docker.
            Right now, as a freelance developer, I create projects with Pyhton, and Bash via Upwork.

        <h3>Flashcard</h3>
        <p>A flashcard or flash card (also known as an index card) is a card bearing information on both sides, which is
            intended to be used as an aid in memorization. Each flashcard bears a question on one side and an answer on
            the other. Flashcards are often used to memorize vocabulary, historical dates, formulas or any subject
            matter that can be learned via a question-and-answer format. Flashcards can be virtual (part of a flashcard
            software), or physical.
            Flashcards are an application of the testing effect âˆ’ the finding that long-term memory is increased when
            some of the learning period is devoted to retrieving the information through testing with proper feedback.
            Study habits affect the rate at which a flashcard-user learns, and proper spacing of flashcards has been
            proven to accelerate learning. A number of spaced repetition software programs exist which take advantage of
            this principle.</p>
